This is the documentation for the hotel project using parquet to store the data

First of all, this project will be developed in Python, using Pycharm, and the version with the IDE
Second, we are going to need to install the 'tkinter' library in order to create windows, you can install it with the following command
        'pip install tkinter'    (Execute this command in the terminal inside of the IDE that you've choosen)
        
After that in the same terminal, execute the following command
        'python -m pip install pyarrow pandas'
If you are using anaconda, use this one
        'conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow'

This library is the one that helps us to use the parquets (FOR MORE INFORMATION ENTER TO THIS URL --->  https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2024/05/06/how-to-read-and-write-parquet-files-with-python/)
This is the documentation for the Pyarrow library --> https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html
We also are installing pandas, so this is the documentation for pandas --> https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html
